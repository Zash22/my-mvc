# my-mvc
Vanilla PHP MVC framework project test

Today you will be creating a little shopping list tool.
Even though it's a simple exercise, the deliverable tells us a lot about your technical abilities.
Please make sure the shopping list can do the following:
● Add items
● Delete items
● Edit items
● Mark items as checked

SUBMISSIONS
Once you are ready you will be required to submit your:
● git repository URL
● publicly accessible URL where the solution is deployed
● any database DDLs
● any database DMLs (if the database requires seeding)
● Anything else you think will be valuable for us to consider when reviewing your submission

CONSIDERATIONS
● This is a timed 3 hour assessment
○ Please make sure you send your submission within the allocated time whether
working or not.

● NO USE OF ANY FRAMEWORKS
○ YES - this means no Laravel, CodeIgniter, Symfony or any other siblings.
○ We pride ourselves on our custom codebase, and what it has achieved and we want
you to add to its footprint/value
○ You are allowed to pull in third-party libraries via composer (if needed) as well as
npm (or similar JS dependency/package manager)

● Create your own mini MVC-type framework
○ By now you should have been exposed to several frameworks and although we do
not use any frameworks we still apply framework-type thinking in our solution and
everyday approach
● Use a git version control system
○ You can use any publicly hosted git repository platform (such as Bitbucket, Github,
GitLab) to commit your code.
○ When submitting please ensure that your git repository is set to public and that your
commits and code are available for cloning

● Use Object Orientated Principles (OOP)
○ Nothing more to say here....
● A publicly accessible URL where your project/solution is deployed
○ We need you to be able to access your solution and view your implementation
